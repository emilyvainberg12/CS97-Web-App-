# CS97 Web-App: CCLE 

### To run the code:

`git clone https://github.com/emilyvainberg12/CS97-Web-App-.git`
`cd ccle`
`npm install`

This will install all the required dependencies.
**The following steps are necessary only if you want to test
logging to console behaviour with Express (very basic). The code is currently on the branch *prathyush*.**:

- `cd ccle/server`
- `node server.js`
- Open a new terminal tab and make sure you're in the ccle directory: `npm start`
- This will run the server and client on two separate terminals
- To observe the logging to console behaviour, search for something in the search-bar and look at Console.
